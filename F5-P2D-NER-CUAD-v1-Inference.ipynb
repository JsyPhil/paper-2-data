Once served the Conversion Notice shall be irrevocable. 5.2 At any time following the second anniversary of this Agreement, the Company shall have the right to convert the Investment into the Conversion Shares at the Conversion Rate by providing notice in writing to the Investor pursuant to clause 6.1. 6 Investor Notice 6.1 If and when a Conversion Event specified in clause 4.1.1 , 4.1.4 or 5.2 is proposed, the Company shall give the Investor not less than 30 business days' prior written notice of the proposed Conversion Event specifying (to the best of its knowledge) the terms and prospective date of the Conversion Event. 6.2 If the Company has given notice to the Investor of a proposed Conversion Event (specified in clause 4.1.1 or 4.1.4 or 5.2), and it becomes apparent to the Company that the Conversion Event is not after all to take effect, the Company shall promptly give notice to the Investor to that effect and the conversion will not take place. 6.3 If the Investor gives a Conversion Notice to the Company in accordance with this clause 6, the Company shall within 14 Business Days of receipt of the Conversion Notice give to the Investor notice of the Conversion Date which will be a date that falls between 30 and 60 Business Days after the Company receives the Conversion Notice. 7 Conversion Shares 7.1 On the Conversion Date, the Directors shall convert the principal amount of the Investment into the Conversion Shares. 7.2 On the Conversion Date the Investor shall be deemed to irrevocably authorise and instruct the Company to apply the Investment moneys payable to the Investor in subscribing for Shares on conversion of the Investment. 7.3 Upon the issue of the Conversion Shares to the Investor, the Investor will irrevocably waive all and any rights in relation to the Investment. The Conversion Shares arising on conversion of the Investment shall be credited as fully paid and rank pari passu with Shares (of the same class) in issue on the Conversion Date and shall carry the right to receive all dividends and other distributions declared after the Conversion Date. 7.4 The Company agrees to issue the Conversion Shares to the Investor free from all and any security interests, liens, charges and other encumbrances and with all accrued rights and benefits attaching thereto at Completion. 7.5 The Company undertakes that, prior to the Conversion Date, it shall: 7.5.1 not alter the Articles in any way which would adversely affect the rights of the Investor without the prior sanction of a Special Resolution; and 7.5.2 maintain sufficient shareholder authority to satisfy in full the most onerous of the outstanding rights of conversion for the time being attaching to the Investment. 8 Completion 8.1 On the Conversion Date, the Company shall issue the Conversion Shares to the Investor and shall procure that: 8.1.1 the Investor is registered as the holder of the Conversion Shares in the Company’s register of members; and 8.1.2 the Investor is provided with the relevant share certificates to evidence its ownership of the Conversion Shares. 9 Representations and Warranties 9.1 Both the Company and the Investor have the right, power and authority and have taken all actions necessary to execute and to exercise their rights and perform their obligations under this Agreement. 9.2 This Agreement has been duly executed by each of the Company and the Investor and constitutes legally valid and binding obligations of each of the Company and the Investor, enforceable against it except to the extent that such enforceability may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganisation and other similar laws relating to or limiting creditors' rights generally. 9.3 In order to induce the Investor to enter into this Agreement and to advance the Investment hereunder, the Company represents and warrants to the Investor as at the date to this Agreement: 9.3.1 the execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement will not result in any breach of or default under any other agreement or instrument to which the Company is a party or is subject which would have a material adverse effect to its business or financial condition; and 9.3.2 no litigation or proceeding is instituted, pending, or to the Company's knowledge, threatened against it or any of its assets. 10 Costs and Expenses 10.1 The Company shall pay for all costs and expenses (including without limitation, legal fees) incurred in connection with the preparation, execution and enforcement of this Agreement, associated costs relating to the registration of trademarks, intellectual property and the completion of the transactions herein contemplated.
