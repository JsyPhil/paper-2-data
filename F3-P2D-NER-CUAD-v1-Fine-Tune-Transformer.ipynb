    "Before we can feed those texts to our model, we need to preprocess them specifically for the pre-trained model that we are using. Even though we have already tokenized and split our words into a list, each model will have it's own further method of tokenization to match the dictionary for each specific model. \n",
    "\n",
    "This is done by a 🤗 Transformers Tokenizer which will (as the name indicates) tokenize the inputs (including converting the tokens to their corresponding IDs in the pretrained vocabulary) and put it in a format the model expects, as well as generate the other inputs that model requires.\n",
    "\n",
    "To do all of this, we instantiate our tokenizer with the AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained method, which will ensure:\n",
    " - we get a tokenizer that corresponds to the model architecture we want to use,\n",
    " - we download the vocabulary used when pretraining this specific checkpoint.\n",

    "\n",
    "If, as is the case here, inputs have already been split into words,we pass the list of words to the tokenzier with the argument \"is_split_into_words=True\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Some tokens will be split into subtokens if the token is not in the model dictionary. This means that we need to do some processing on our labels as the input ids returned by the tokenizer are longer than the lists of labels our dataset contain, first because some special tokens might be added (eg a [CLS] and a [SEP]) and then because of those possible splits of words in multiple tokens.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some tokenizers returns outputs that have a word_ids method which can help us. Otherwise we have to build our own, as is the case for DeBERTa for example.\n",
