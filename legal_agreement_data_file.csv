BACKGROUND HPS (or one of its affiliates other than SHPS) provides certain administrative services and Care Management Services (as defined below) to clients (""Clients"") pursuant to the terms of agreements with such Clients (the ""Client Agreements"") as of January 1, 1998. HPS desires that SHPS provide, and SHPS is willing to provide, the Care Management Services to the Clients on behalf of HPS in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement. Accordingly, in consideration of the mutual covenants and agreements set forth below, the parties agree as follows: TERMS 1. SERVICES PROVIDED; TERM AND TERMINATION 1.1 AGREEMENT TO OUTSOURCE CARE MANAGEMENT SERVICES. HPS agrees to outsource to SHPS, and hereby appoints SHPS as the exclusive provider of, Care Management Services to the Clients, subject to the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement. SHPS shall provide the Care Management Services directly to the Clients in accordance with the terms of the Client Agreements. ""Care Management Services"" means the business of providing utilization review (which includes, but is not limited to, pre-admission certification, prior authorization, prospective length of stay approvals, second opinions, concurrent review and discharge planning), catastrophic medical case management, disease management and demand management (24 hours per day, 7 days per week) services to benefits payors and health providers, in all cases in accordance with the terms of the applicable Client Agreement. 1.2 TERM. The term of this Agreement will commence on January 1, 1998 (the ""Effective Date"") and will end on December 31, 1998. Unless either party gives the other at least ninety days' prior written notice that it has elected not to extend the term of this Agreement beyond December 31, 1998, the term of this Agreement will be automatically extended until December 31, 1999. Thereafter this Agreement will automatically be renewed for successive additional periods of one year, unless either party gives notice of cancellation on or before October 1 of any such year. 1.3 TERMINATION FOR CAUSE. In the event that either party materially or repeatedly defaults in the performance of any of its duties or obligations hereunder and does not substantially cure such default within thirty days after being given written notice specifying the default, or, with respect to those defaults which cannot reasonably be cured within thirty days, if the defaulting party fails to proceed promptly after being given such notice to commence curing the default and thereafter to reasonably proceed to cure the same, then the party not in default 2 may, by giving written notice to the defaulting party, terminate this Agreement as of a date specified in such notice of termination. 2. PAYMENTS 2.1 FEES FOR CURRENT HPS CLIENTS. For each month during the term of this Agreement, HPS will pay to SHPS an amount equal to (i) eighty-two and one-half percent (82.5%) of the first $500,000 of Care Management Revenues (as defined below) during such month plus (ii) eighty percent (80%) of Care Management Revenues during such month in excess of $500,000. HPS shall pay such amount to SHPS within fifteen days following the end of the applicable month. At the time of payment HPS shall submit to SHPS a schedule for the month of payment setting forth the calculation of fees payable under this Section 2.1 and Care Management Revenues by Client. 2.2 CALCULATION OF CARE MANAGEMENT REVENUES. ""Care Management Revenues"" means, with respect to any month during the term, the revenues collected by HPS from Clients (or new Clients, as applicable) for the Care Management Services. Monthly revenues for Care Management Services shall be calculated based on a per employee per month fee equal to: (i) the amount (as of the date of this Agreement) set forth in the applicable Client Agreement (including hourly medical case management fees); or (ii) if the Client Agreement does not include a per employee per month fee for Care Management Services, $2.00 (this amount shall apply to all individual and small group business). Prospectively, for new Clients, SHPS and HPS shall agree to the rate HPS will offer to such new Clients (including hourly medical case management fees). 2.3 ALLOCATION OF COSTS. SHPS shall pay to HPS its allocable portion (which portion shall approximate HPS' direct costs chargeable to the business function) of depreciation, information system services, rent and utilities for the use by SHPS of HPS facilities in connection with its delivery of Care Management Services to the Clients. SHPS shall also reimburse HPS for direct costs for postage and telecommunications incurred by HPS in connection with such use by SHPS of HPS facilities. For convenience, the parties acknowledge that HPS will deduct amounts owed by SHPS under this Section 2.3 from the fees described in Section 2.1 and reflect such deductions in the schedule prepared by HPS. 2.4 NEW CLIENTS. In the event that HPS (or one of its affiliates other than SHPS) enters into an agreement to provide Care Management Services with a client which is not a Client as of the date of this Agreement (a ""New Client""), SHPS shall provide such Care Management Services to the New Client in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. HPS will pay to SHPS all Care Management Revenues collected from such New Client, and SHPS will pay a commission to HPS equal to five percent (5%) of such amount received by SHPS from HPS pursuant to this Section 2.4. HPS shall pay such amount to SHPS within fifteen days following the end of each month. At the time of payment HPS shall submit to SHPS a schedule for the month of payment setting forth the calculation of fees payable under this Section 2.4 and Care 2 3 Management Revenues by New Client. For convenience, the parties acknowledge that HPS will deduct amounts owed by SHPS under this Section 2.4 from the amounts owed by HPS under this Section 2.4 and reflect such deductions in the schedule prepared by HPS. 2.5 REPORTS; AUDIT RIGHTS. For the purpose of determining the fees payable to SHPS under this Agreement, HPS shall preserve adequate records of Care Management Revenues by Client. SHPS shall have the right, upon reasonable prior written notice, to examine, copy and audit such records. Such audit shall be conducted at the location where such records are maintained and shall be at the expense of SHPS. Notwithstanding the foregoing, should any audit reveal that additional payments to SHPS are due which exceed five percent (5%) of the amount paid to SHPS for the period under audit, HPS shall pay SHPS on demand for the cost of such audit. 3.

(d) Any subservicing arrangement that may be entered into and any other transactions or services relating to the Serviced Assets involving a Sub-Servicer in its capacity as such shall be deemed to be solely between the Sub-Servicer and the Servicer alone, and the Owner shall not be deemed party thereto and shall have no claims, rights, obligations, duties, or liabilities with respect to the Sub-Servicer in such capacity.
